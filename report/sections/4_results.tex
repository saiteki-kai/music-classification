\section{Results and Evaluation}
The Results section is dedicated to presenting the actual results (i.e. measured and calculated quantities), not to discussing their meaning or interpretation.
The results should be summarized using appropriate Tables and Figures (graphs or schematics).
Every Figure and Table should have a legend that describes concisely what is contained or shown.
Figure legends go below the figure, table legends above the table.
Throughout the report, but especially in this section, pay attention to reporting numbers with an appropriate number of significant figures.
