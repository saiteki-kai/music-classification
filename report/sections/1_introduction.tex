\section{Introduction}
Nowadays, with the high traffic of multimedia data, it becomes more and more 
necessary to be able to organize, in an automatic way, one's music. 
With a better audio classification, for instance, speech recognition and recommendation algorithms can be improved.
The task considered for this project is the classification of music 
genres from audio files.
It is assumed that only one musical genre is associated with each audio track. 
The problem has been approached with an initial study of the theory and the state of the art. 
Then, it was tried to overcome the results obtained with approaches seen in class, as transfer learning.
