\section{Introduction}
Nowadays, with the high traffic of multimedia data, it becomes more and more 
necessary to be able to organize, in an automatic way, one's music. 
With a better audio classification we can improve recommendation algorithms, and discover trends and listener preferences through data analysis. \\

The task we are considering for this project is the classification of music 
genres from audio files.
It is assumed that only one musical genre is associated with each audio track. \\

We've approached the problem with an initial study of the theory and the state of the art. 
We then tried to overcome the results obtained with approaches seen in class, as Transfer Learning. \\
