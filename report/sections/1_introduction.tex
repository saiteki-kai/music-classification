\section{Introduction}
The introduction should provide a clear statement of the problem posed by the project, and why the problem is of interest.
It should reflect the scenario, if available.
If needed, the introduction also needs to present background information so that the reader can understand the significance of the problem.
A brief summary of the hypotheses and the approach your group used to solve the problem should be given,
possibly also including a concise introduction to theory or concepts used later to analyze and to discuss the results.
