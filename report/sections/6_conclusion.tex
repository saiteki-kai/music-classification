\section{Conclusions}
Conclusions should summarize the central points made in the Discussion section, reinforcing for the reader the value and implications of the work.
If the results were not definitive, specific future work that may be needed can be (briefly) described.
The conclusions should never contain ``surprises''.
Therefore, any conclusions should be based on observations and data already discussed.
It is considered extremely bad form to introduce new data in the conclusions.
