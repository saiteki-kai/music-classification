\section{Conclusions}

Various methods for classifying audio genres have been tried.
The approach based on spectrograms and Convolutional Neural Networks was the worst. 
The Handcrafted Features based approach proved to be a good alternative. 
The approach with the best results turned out to be the one based on Transfer Learning.
The use of spectrograms is however indispensable for these types of problems.
